# Coding Exercise for Crunchr Front End Developer

## Problem Description

A client owns many companies with employees located over several
locations. The client wants to be able to view various statistics about
his companies and their employees over the different locations.

The goal of this exercise is to create a small website. However the most
important thing is that your code is readable, maintainable, scalable,
well structured, etc. Please use whichever tools / frameworks you
see fit.

## Requirements

The client would like to be able to have a list of all the companies
which have at least N% employees on a given location.

The user should be able to select the location from a dropdown, when
clicking "Search" a request should be performed to the appropriate
endpoint with this location id as a query parameter, and the results 
should be displayed.

If you have time you can provide the user with the ability to filter
the results based on a given percentage. This percentage should be
given to the backend when requesting and the filtering will be done
for you in the backend.

## The API

You are working as part of a full-stack team and another colleague has
already implemented the backend that will drive the page. They have
given you this implementation and api.yaml which specifies the API. In
order to run the API you will need python 3 installed...

```
python3 main.py
```

You should fill in the static directory with your front end
implementation.

## Time

As an indication we don't want you to spend more than 8 hours on the
task. Please mark down how much time you spend on the whole problem as
an indication for us.

If anything is unclear then please feel free to ask questions to clarify
the requirements.

Good Luck!!
